accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, simple to test, and better at handling failures.The mental model is that a saga is like a separate thread in your application that's solely responsible for side effects. redux-saga is a redux middleware, which means this thread can be started, paused and cancelled from the main application with normal redux actions, it has access to the full redux application state and it can dispatch redux actions as well.It uses an ES6 feature called Generators to make those asynchronous flows easy to read, write and test. (if you're not familiar with them here are some introductory links) By doing so, these asynchronous flows look like your standard synchronous JavaScript code. (kind of like async/await, but generators have a few more awesome features we need)You might've used redux-thunk before to handle your data fetching. Contrary to redux thunk, you don't end up in callback hell, you can test your asynchronous flows easily and your actions stay pure.Getting startedInstall$ npm install --save redux-saga\nor$ yarn add redux-saga\nAlternatively, you may use the provided UMD builds directly in the  tag of an HTML page. See this section.Usage ExampleSuppose we have a UI to fetch some user data from a remote server when a button is clicked. (For brevity, we'll just show the action triggering code.)class UserComponent extends React.Component {\n  ...\n  onSomeButtonClicked() {\n    const { userId, dispatch } = this.props\n    dispatch({type: 'USER_FETCH_REQUESTED', payload: {userId}})\n  }\n  ...\n}\nThe Component dispatches a plain Object action to the Store. We'll create a Saga that watches for all USER_FETCH_REQUESTED actions and triggers an API call to fetch the user data.sagas.jsimport { call, put, takeEvery, takeLatest } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport Api from '...'\n\n// worker Saga: will be fired on USER_FETCH_REQUESTED actions\nfunction* fetchUser(action) {\n   try {\n      const user = yield call(Api.fetchUser, action.payload.userId);\n      yield put({type: \"USER_FETCH_SUCCEEDED\", user: user});\n   } catch (e) {\n      yield put({type: \"USER_FETCH_FAILED\", message: e.message});\n   }\n}\n\n/*\n  Starts fetchUser on each dispatched `USER_FETCH_REQUESTED` action.\n  Allows concurrent fetches of user.\n*/\nfunction* mySaga() {\n  yield takeEvery(\"USER_FETCH_REQUESTED\", fetchUser);\n}\n\n/*\n  Alternatively you may use takeLatest.\n\n  Does not allow concurrent fetches of user. If \"USER_FETCH_REQUESTED\" gets\n  dispatched while a fetch is already pending, that pending fetch is cancelled\n  and only the latest one will be run.\n*/\nfunction* mySaga() {\n  yield takeLatest(\"USER_FETCH_REQUESTED\", fetchUser);\n}\n\nexport default mySaga;\nTo run our Saga, we'll have to connect it to the Redux Store using the redux-saga middleware.main.jsimport { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\nimport createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga'\n\nimport reducer from './reducers'\nimport mySaga from './sagas'\n\n// create the saga middleware\nconst sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware()\n// mount it on the Store\nconst store = createStore(\n  reducer,\n  applyMiddleware(sagaMiddleware)\n)\n\n// then run the saga\nsagaMiddleware.run(mySaga)\n\n// render the application\nDocumentationIntroduction\n\nBasic Concepts\n\nAdvanced Concepts\n\nRecipes\n\nExternal Resources\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nGlossary\n\nAPI Reference\n\nTranslationChinese\n\nTraditional Chinese\n\nJapanese\n\nKorean\n\nPortuguese\n\nRussian\n\nUsing umd build in the browserThere is also a umd build of redux-saga available in the dist/ folder. When using the umd build redux-saga is available as ReduxSaga in the window object. This enables you to create Saga middleware without using ES6 import syntax like this:var sagaMiddleware = ReduxSaga.default()\nThe umd version is useful if you don't use Webpack or Browserify. You can access it directly from unpkg.The following builds are available:https://unpkg.com/redux-saga/dist/redux-saga.js\n\nhttps://unpkg.com/redux-saga/dist/redux-saga.min.js\n\nImportant! If the browser you are targeting doesn't support ES2015 generators, you must transpile them (i.e. with babel plugin) and provide a valid runtime, such as the one here. The runtime must be imported before redux-saga:import 'regenerator-runtime/runtime'\n// then\nimport sagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga'\nBuilding examples from sources$ git clone https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga.git\n$ cd redux-saga\n$ npm install\n$ npm test\nBelow are the examples ported (so far) from the Redux repos.Counter examplesThere are three counter examples.counter-vanillaDemo using vanilla JavaScript and UMD builds. All source is inlined in index.html.To launch the example, just open index.html in your browser.Important: your browser must support Generators. Latest versions of Chrome/Firefox/Edge are suitable.counterDemo using webpack and high-level API takeEvery.$ npm run counter\n\n# test sample for the generator\n$ npm run test-counter\ncancellable-counterDemo using low-level API to demonstrate task cancellation.$ npm run cancellable-counter\nShopping Cart example$ npm run shop\n\n# test sample for the generator\n$ npm run test-shop\nasync example$ npm run async\n\n# test sample for the generators\n$ npm run test-async\nreal-world example (with webpack hot reloading)$ npm run real-world\n\n# sorry, no tests yet\nTypeScriptRedux-Saga with TypeScript requires DOM.Iterable or ES2015.Iterable. If your target is ES6, you are likely already set, however, for ES5, you will need to add it yourself.\nCheck your tsconfig.json file, and the official compiler options documentation.LogoYou can find the official Redux-Saga logo with different flavors in the logo directory.BackersSupport us with a monthly donation and help us continue our activities.

Introduction","keywords":"","body":"IntroductionBeginner Tutorial\n\nBackground on the Saga concept\n\n"},"docs/introduction/BeginnerTutorial.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/BeginnerTutorial.html","title":"1.1 Beginner Tutorial","keywords":"","body":"Beginner TutorialObjectives of this tutorialThis tutorial attempts to introduce redux-saga in a (hopefully) accessible way.For our getting started tutorial, we are going to use the trivial Counter demo from the Redux repo. The application is quite simple but is a good fit to illustrate the basic concepts of redux-saga without being lost in excessive details.The initial setupBefore we start, clone the tutorial repository.The final code of this tutorial is located in the sagas branch.Then in the command line, run:$ cd redux-saga-beginner-tutorial\n$ npm install\nTo start the application, run:$ npm start\nWe are starting with the simplest use case: 2 buttons to Increment and Decrement a counter. Later, we will introduce asynchronous calls.If things go well, you should see 2 buttons Increment and Decrement along with a message below showing Counter: 0.In case you encountered an issue with running the application. Feel free to create an issue on the tutorial repo.Hello Sagas!We are going to create our first Saga. Following the tradition, we will write our 'Hello, world' version for Sagas.Create a file sagas.js then add the following snippet:export function* helloSaga() {\n  console.log('Hello Sagas!')\n}\nSo nothing scary, just a normal function (except for the *). All it does is print a greeting message into the console.In order to run our Saga, we need to:create a Saga middleware with a list of Sagas to run (so far we have only one helloSaga)\n\nconnect the Saga middleware to the Redux store\n\nWe will make the changes to main.js:// ...\nimport { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\nimport createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga'\n\n// ...\nimport { helloSaga } from './sagas'\n\nconst sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware()\nconst store = createStore(\n  reducer,\n  applyMiddleware(sagaMiddleware)\n)\nsagaMiddleware.run(helloSaga)\n\nconst action = type => store.dispatch({type})\n\n// rest unchanged\nFirst we import our Saga from the ./sagas module. Then we create a middleware using the factory function createSagaMiddleware exported by the redux-saga library.Before running our helloSaga, we must connect our middleware to the Store using applyMiddleware. Then we can use the sagaMiddleware.run(helloSaga) to start our Saga.So far, our Saga does nothing special. It just logs a message then exits.Making Asynchronous callsNow let's add something closer to the original Counter demo. To illustrate asynchronous calls, we will add another button to increment the counter 1 second after the click.First things first, we'll provide an additional button and a callback onIncrementAsync to the UI component.const Counter = ({ value, onIncrement, onDecrement, onIncrementAsync }) =>\n  \n    \n      Increment after 1 second\n    \n    {' '}\n    \n      Increment\n    \n    {' '}\n    \n      Decrement\n    \n    \n    \n      Clicked: {value} times\n    \n  \nNext we should connect the onIncrementAsync of the Component to a Store action.We will modify the main.js module as followsfunction render() {\n  ReactDOM.render(\n     action('INCREMENT')}\n      onDecrement={() => action('DECREMENT')}\n      onIncrementAsync={() => action('INCREMENT_ASYNC')} />,\n    document.getElementById('root')\n  )\n}\nNote that unlike in redux-thunk, our component dispatches a plain object action.Now we will introduce another Saga to perform the asynchronous call. Our use case is as follows:On each INCREMENT_ASYNC action, we want to start a task that will do the followingWait 1 second then increment the counter\n\nAdd the following code to the sagas.js module:import { delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { put, takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\n// ...\n\n// Our worker Saga: will perform the async increment task\nexport function* incrementAsync() {\n  yield delay(1000)\n  yield put({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n}\n\n// Our watcher Saga: spawn a new incrementAsync task on each INCREMENT_ASYNC\nexport function* watchIncrementAsync() {\n  yield takeEvery('INCREMENT_ASYNC', incrementAsync)\n}\nTime for some explanations.We import delay, a utility function that returns a Promise that will resolve after a specified number of milliseconds. We'll use this function to block the Generator.Sagas are implemented as Generator functions that yield objects to the redux-saga middleware. The yielded objects are a kind of instruction to be interpreted by the middleware. When a Promise is yielded to the middleware, the middleware will suspend the Saga until the Promise completes. In the above example, the incrementAsync Saga is suspended until the Promise returned by delay resolves, which will happen after 1 second.Once the Promise is resolved, the middleware will resume the Saga, executing code until the next yield. In this example, the next statement is another yielded object: the result of calling put({type: 'INCREMENT'}), which instructs the middleware to dispatch an INCREMENT action.put is one example of what we call an Effect. Effects are simple JavaScript objects which contain instructions to be fulfilled by the middleware. When a middleware retrieves an Effect yielded by a Saga, the Saga is paused until the Effect is fulfilled.So to summarize, the incrementAsync Saga sleeps for 1 second via the call to delay(1000), then dispatches an INCREMENT action.Next, we created another Saga watchIncrementAsync. We use takeEvery, a helper function provided by redux-saga, to listen for dispatched INCREMENT_ASYNC actions and run incrementAsync each time.Now we have 2 Sagas, and we need to start them both at once. To do that, we'll add a rootSaga that is responsible for starting our other Sagas. In the same file sagas.js, refactor the file as follows:import { delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { put, takeEvery, all } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\n\nfunction* incrementAsync() {\n  yield delay(1000)\n  yield put({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n}\n\n\nfunction* watchIncrementAsync() {\n  yield takeEvery('INCREMENT_ASYNC', incrementAsync)\n}\n\n\n// notice how we now only export the rootSaga\n// single entry point to start all Sagas at once\nexport default function* rootSaga() {\n  yield all([\n    helloSaga(),\n    watchIncrementAsync()\n  ])\n}\nThis Saga yields an array with the results of calling our two sagas, helloSaga and watchIncrementAsync. This means the two resulting Generators will be started in parallel. Now we only have to invoke sagaMiddleware.run on the root Saga in main.js.// ...\nimport rootSaga from './sagas'\n\nconst sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware()\nconst store = ...\nsagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga)\n\n// ...\nMaking our code testableWe want to test our incrementAsync Saga to make sure it performs the desired task.Create another file sagas.spec.js:import test from 'tape';\n\nimport { incrementAsync } from './sagas'\n\ntest('incrementAsync Saga test', (assert) => {\n  const gen = incrementAsync()\n\n  // now what ?\n});\nincrementAsync is a generator function. When run, it returns an iterator object, and the iterator's next method returns an object with the following shapegen.next() // => { done: boolean, value: any }\nThe value field contains the yielded expression, i.e. the result of the expression after\nthe yield. The done field indicates if the generator has terminated or if there are still\nmore 'yield' expressions.In the case of incrementAsync, the generator yields 2 values consecutively:yield delay(1000)\n\nyield put({type: 'INCREMENT'})\n\nSo if we invoke the next method of the generator 3 times consecutively we get the following\nresults:gen.next() // => { done: false, value:  }\ngen.next() // => { done: false, value:  }\ngen.next() // => { done: true, value: undefined }\nThe first 2 invocations return the results of the yield expressions. On the 3rd invocation\nsince there is no more yield the done field is set to true. And since the incrementAsync\nGenerator doesn't return anything (no return statement), the value field is set to\nundefined.So now, in order to test the logic inside incrementAsync, we'll simply have to iterate\nover the returned Generator and check the values yielded by the generator.import test from 'tape';\n\nimport { incrementAsync } from './sagas'\n\ntest('incrementAsync Saga test', (assert) => {\n  const gen = incrementAsync()\n\n  assert.deepEqual(\n    gen.next(),\n    { done: false, value: ??? },\n    'incrementAsync should return a Promise that will resolve after 1 second'\n  )\n});\nThe issue is how do we test the return value of delay? We can't do a simple equality test\non Promises. If delay returned a normal value, things would've been easier to test.Well, redux-saga provides a way to make the above statement possible. Instead of calling\ndelay(1000) directly inside incrementAsync, we'll call it indirectly:import { delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { put, takeEvery, all, call } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\n// ...\n\nexport function* incrementAsync() {\n  // use the call Effect\n  yield call(delay, 1000)\n  yield put({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n}\nInstead of doing yield delay(1000), we're now doing yield call(delay, 1000). What's the difference?In the first case, the yield expression delay(1000) is evaluated before it gets passed to the caller of next (the caller could be the middleware when running our code. It could also be our test code which runs the Generator function and iterates over the returned Generator). So what the caller gets is a Promise, like in the test code above.In the second case, the yield expression call(delay, 1000) is what gets passed to the caller of next. call just like put, returns an Effect which instructs the middleware to call a given function with the given arguments. In fact, neither put nor call performs any dispatch or asynchronous call by themselves, they simply return plain JavaScript objects.put({type: 'INCREMENT'}) // => { PUT: {type: 'INCREMENT'} }\ncall(delay, 1000)        // => { CALL: {fn: delay, args: [1000]}}\nWhat happens is that the middleware examines the type of each yielded Effect then decides how to fulfill that Effect. If the Effect type is a PUT then it will dispatch an action to the Store. If the Effect is a CALL then it'll call the given function.This separation between Effect creation and Effect execution makes it possible to test our Generator in a surprisingly easy way:import test from 'tape';\n\nimport { put, call } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport { delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { incrementAsync } from './sagas'\n\ntest('incrementAsync Saga test', (assert) => {\n  const gen = incrementAsync()\n\n  assert.deepEqual(\n    gen.next().value,\n    call(delay, 1000),\n    'incrementAsync Saga must call delay(1000)'\n  )\n\n  assert.deepEqual(\n    gen.next().value,\n    put({type: 'INCREMENT'}),\n    'incrementAsync Saga must dispatch an INCREMENT action'\n  )\n\n  assert.deepEqual(\n    gen.next(),\n    { done: true, value: undefined },\n    'incrementAsync Saga must be done'\n  )\n\n  assert.end()\n});\nSince put and call return plain objects, we can reuse the same functions in our test code. And to test the logic of incrementAsync, we simply iterate over the generator and do deepEqual tests on its values.In order to run the above test, run:$ npm test\nwhich should report the results on the console."},"docs/introduction/SagaBackground.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/SagaBackground.html","title":"1.2 Saga Background","keywords":"","body":"Background on the Saga conceptWIPFor now, here are some useful links.External linksApplying the Saga Pattern (Youtube video) By Caitie McCaffrey\n\nOriginal paper By Hector Garcia-Molina & Kenneth Salem\n\nA Saga on Sagas from MSDN site\n\n"},"docs/basics/":{"url":"docs/basics/","title":"2.

In the advanced section, we'll see how those functions can be implemented.The first function, takeEvery is the most familiar and provides a behavior similar to redux-thunk.Let's illustrate with the common AJAX example. On each click on a Fetch button we dispatch a FETCH_REQUESTED action. We want to handle this action by launching a task that will fetch some data from the server.First we create the task that will perform the asynchronous action:import { call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nexport function* fetchData(action) {\n   try {\n      const data = yield call(Api.fetchUser, action.payload.url)\n      yield put({type: \"FETCH_SUCCEEDED\", data})\n   } catch (error) {\n      yield put({type: \"FETCH_FAILED\", error})\n   }\n}\nTo launch the above task on each FETCH_REQUESTED action:import { takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchFetchData() {\n  yield takeEvery('FETCH_REQUESTED', fetchData)\n}\nIn the above example, takeEvery allows multiple fetchData instances to be started concurrently. At a given moment, we can start a new fetchData task while there are still one or more previous fetchData tasks which have not yet terminated.If we want to only get the response of the latest request fired (e.g. to always display the latest version of data) we can use the takeLatest helper:import { takeLatest } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchFetchData() {\n  yield takeLatest('FETCH_REQUESTED', fetchData)\n}\nUnlike takeEvery, takeLatest allows only one fetchData task to run at any moment. And it will be the latest started task. If a previous task is still running when another fetchData task is started, the previous task will be automatically cancelled.If you have multiple Sagas watching for different actions, you can create multiple watchers with those built-in helpers, which will behave like there was fork used to spawn them (we'll talk about fork later. For now, consider it to be an Effect that allows us to start multiple sagas in the background).For example:import { takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\n// FETCH_USERS\nfunction* fetchUsers(action) { ... }\n\n// CREATE_USER\nfunction* createUser(action) { ... }\n\n// use them in parallel\nexport default function* rootSaga() {\n  yield takeEvery('FETCH_USERS', fetchUsers)\n  yield takeEvery('CREATE_USER', createUser)\n}\n"},"docs/basics/DeclarativeEffects.html":{"url":"docs/basics/DeclarativeEffects.html","title":"2.2 Declarative Effects","keywords":"","body":"Declarative EffectsIn redux-saga, Sagas are implemented using Generator functions. To express the Saga logic, we yield plain JavaScript Objects from the Generator. We call those Objects Effects. An Effect is simply an object that contains some information to be interpreted by the middleware. You can view Effects like instructions to the middleware to perform some operation (e.g., invoke some asynchronous function, dispatch an action to the store, etc.).To create Effects, you use the functions provided by the library in the redux-saga/effects package.In this section and the following, we will introduce some basic Effects. And see how the concept allows the Sagas to be easily tested.Sagas can yield Effects in multiple forms. The simplest way is to yield a Promise.For example suppose we have a Saga that watches a PRODUCTS_REQUESTED action. On each matching action, it starts a task to fetch a list of products from a server.import { takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport Api from './path/to/api'\n\nfunction* watchFetchProducts() {\n  yield takeEvery('PRODUCTS_REQUESTED', fetchProducts)\n}\n\nfunction* fetchProducts() {\n  const products = yield Api.fetch('/products')\n  console.log(products)\n}\nIn the example above, we are invoking Api.fetch directly from inside the Generator (In Generator functions, any expression at the right of yield is evaluated then the result is yielded to the caller).Api.fetch('/products') triggers an AJAX request and returns a Promise that will resolve with the resolved response, the AJAX request will be executed immediately. Simple and idiomatic, but...Suppose we want to test the generator above:const iterator = fetchProducts()\nassert.deepEqual(iterator.next().value, ??) // what do we expect ?\nWe want to check the result of the first value yielded by the generator. In our case it's the result of running Api.fetch('/products') which is a Promise . Executing the real service during tests is neither a viable nor practical approach, so we have to mock the Api.fetch function, i.e. we'll have to replace the real function with a fake one which doesn't actually run the AJAX request but only checks that we've called Api.fetch with the right arguments ('/products' in our case).Mocks make testing more difficult and less reliable. On the other hand, functions that simply return values are easier to test, since we can use a simple equal() to check the result. This is the way to write the most reliable tests.Not convinced? I encourage you to read Eric Elliott's article:(...)equal(), by nature answers the two most important questions every unit test must answer,\nbut most don’t:What is the actual output?\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nIf you finish a test without answering those two questions, you don’t have a real unit test. You have a sloppy, half-baked test.What we actually need is just to make sure the fetchProducts task yields a call with the right function and the right arguments.Instead of invoking the asynchronous function directly from inside the Generator, we can yield only a description of the function invocation. i.e. We'll simply yield an object which looks like// Effect -> call the function Api.fetch with `./products` as argument\n{\n  CALL: {\n    fn: Api.fetch,\n    args: ['./products']\n  }\n}\nPut another way, the Generator will yield plain Objects containing instructions, and the redux-saga middleware will take care of executing those instructions and giving back the result of their execution to the Generator. This way, when testing the Generator, all we need to do is to check that it yields the expected instruction by doing a simple deepEqual on the yielded Object.For this reason, the library provides a different way to perform asynchronous calls.import { call } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* fetchProducts() {\n  const products = yield call(Api.fetch, '/products')\n  // ...\n}\nWe're using now the call(fn, ...args) function. The difference from the preceding example is that now we're not executing the fetch call immediately, instead, call creates a description of the effect. Just as in Redux you use action creators to create a plain object describing the action that will get executed by the Store, call creates a plain object describing the function call. The redux-saga middleware takes care of executing the function call and resuming the generator with the resolved response.This allows us to easily test the Generator outside the Redux environment. Because call is just a function which returns a plain Object.import { call } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport Api from '...'\n\nconst iterator = fetchProducts()\n\n// expects a call instruction\nassert.deepEqual(\n  iterator.next().value,\n  call(Api.fetch, '/products'),\n  \"fetchProducts should yield an Effect call(Api.fetch, './products')\"\n)\nNow we don't need to mock anything, and a simple equality test will suffice.The advantage of those declarative calls is that we can test all the logic inside a Saga by simply iterating over the Generator and doing a deepEqual test on the values yielded successively. This is a real benefit, as your complex asynchronous operations are no longer black boxes, and you can test in detail their operational logic no matter how complex it is.call also supports invoking object methods, you can provide a this context to the invoked functions using the following form:yield call([obj, obj.method], arg1, arg2, ...) // as if we did obj.method(arg1, arg2 ...)\napply is an alias for the method invocation formyield apply(obj, obj.method, [arg1, arg2, ...])\ncall and apply are well suited for functions that return Promise results. Another function cps can be used to handle Node style functions (e.g. fn(...args, callback) where callback is of the form (error, result) => ()). cps stands for Continuation Passing Style.For example:import { cps } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nconst content = yield cps(readFile, '/path/to/file')\nAnd of course you can test it just like you test call:import { cps } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nconst iterator = fetchSaga()\nassert.deepEqual(iterator.next().value, cps(readFile, '/path/to/file') )\ncps also supports the same method invocation form as call."},"docs/basics/DispatchingActions.html":{"url":"docs/basics/DispatchingActions.html","title":"2.3 Dispatching actions","keywords":"","body":"Dispatching actions to the storeTaking the previous example further, let's say that after each save, we want to dispatch some action\nto notify the Store that the fetch has succeeded (we'll omit the failure case for the moment).We could pass the Store's dispatch function to the Generator. Then the\nGenerator could invoke it after receiving the fetch response:// ...\n\nfunction* fetchProducts(dispatch) {\n  const products = yield call(Api.fetch, '/products')\n  dispatch({ type: 'PRODUCTS_RECEIVED', products })\n}\nHowever, this solution has the same drawbacks as invoking functions directly from inside the Generator (as discussed in the previous section). If we want to test that fetchProducts performs\nthe dispatch after receiving the AJAX response, we'll need again to mock the dispatch\nfunction.Instead, we need the same declarative solution. Just create an Object to instruct the\nmiddleware that we need to dispatch some action, and let the middleware perform the real\ndispatch.

Let's suppose that our API function Api.fetch returns a Promise which gets rejected when the remote fetch fails for some reason.We want to handle those errors inside our Saga by dispatching a PRODUCTS_REQUEST_FAILED action to the Store.We can catch errors inside the Saga using the familiar try/catch syntax.import Api from './path/to/api'\nimport { call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\n// ...\n\nfunction* fetchProducts() {\n  try {\n    const products = yield call(Api.fetch, '/products')\n    yield put({ type: 'PRODUCTS_RECEIVED', products })\n  }\n  catch(error) {\n    yield put({ type: 'PRODUCTS_REQUEST_FAILED', error })\n  }\n}\nIn order to test the failure case, we'll use the throw method of the Generatorimport { call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport Api from '...'\n\nconst iterator = fetchProducts()\n\n// expects a call instruction\nassert.deepEqual(\n  iterator.next().value,\n  call(Api.fetch, '/products'),\n  \"fetchProducts should yield an Effect call(Api.fetch, './products')\"\n)\n\n// create a fake error\nconst error = {}\n\n// expects a dispatch instruction\nassert.deepEqual(\n  iterator.throw(error).value,\n  put({ type: 'PRODUCTS_REQUEST_FAILED', error }),\n  \"fetchProducts should yield an Effect put({ type: 'PRODUCTS_REQUEST_FAILED', error })\"\n)\nIn this case, we're passing the throw method a fake error. This will cause the Generator to break the current flow and execute the catch block.Of course, you're not forced to handle your API errors inside try/catch blocks. You can also make your API service return a normal value with some error flag on it. For example, you can catch Promise rejections and map them to an object with an error field.import Api from './path/to/api'\nimport { call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction fetchProductsApi() {\n  return Api.fetch('/products')\n    .then(response => ({ response }))\n    .catch(error => ({ error }))\n}\n\nfunction* fetchProducts() {\n  const { response, error } = yield call(fetchProductsApi)\n  if (response)\n    yield put({ type: 'PRODUCTS_RECEIVED', products: response })\n  else\n    yield put({ type: 'PRODUCTS_REQUEST_FAILED', error })\n}\n"},"docs/basics/Effect.html":{"url":"docs/basics/Effect.html","title":"2.4 A common abstraction: Effect","keywords":"","body":"A common abstraction: EffectTo generalize, triggering Side Effects from inside a Saga is always done by yielding some declarative Effect.

This mimics somewhat the behavior of redux-thunk: each time a Component, for example, invokes a fetchProducts Action Creator, the Action Creator will dispatch a thunk to execute the control flow.In reality, takeEvery is just a wrapper effect for internal helper function built on top of the lower-level and more powerful API. In this section we'll see a new Effect, take, which makes it possible to build complex control flow by allowing total control of the action observation process.A simple loggerLet's take a simple example of a Saga that watches all actions dispatched to the store and logs them to the console.Using takeEvery('*') (with the wildcard * pattern), we can catch all dispatched actions regardless of their types.import { select, takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchAndLog() {\n  yield takeEvery('*', function* logger(action) {\n    const state = yield select()\n\n    console.log('action', action)\n    console.log('state after', state)\n  })\n}\nNow let's see how to use the take Effect to implement the same flow as above:import { select, take } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchAndLog() {\n  while (true) {\n    const action = yield take('*')\n    const state = yield select()\n\n    console.log('action', action)\n    console.log('state after', state)\n  }\n}\nThe take is just like call and put we saw earlier. It creates another command object that tells the middleware to wait for a specific action. The resulting behavior of the call Effect is the same as when the middleware suspends the Generator until a Promise resolves. In the take case, it'll suspend the Generator until a matching action is dispatched. In the above example, watchAndLog is suspended until any action is dispatched.Note how we're running an endless loop while (true). Remember, this is a Generator function, which doesn't have a run-to-completion behavior. Our Generator will block on each iteration waiting for an action to happen.Using take has a subtle impact on how we write our code. In the case of takeEvery, the invoked tasks have no control on when they'll be called. They will be invoked again and again on each matching action. They also have no control on when to stop the observation.In the case of take, the control is inverted. Instead of the actions being pushed to the handler tasks, the Saga is pulling the action by itself. It looks as if the Saga is performing a normal function call action = getNextAction() which will resolve when the action is dispatched.This inversion of control allows us to implement control flows that are non-trivial to do with the traditional push approach.As a simple example, suppose that in our Todo application, we want to watch user actions and show a congratulation message after the user has created his first three todos.import { take, put } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchFirstThreeTodosCreation() {\n  for (let i = 0; i \nInstead of a while (true), we're running a for loop, which will iterate only three times. After taking the first three TODO_CREATED actions, watchFirstThreeTodosCreation will cause the application to display a congratulation message then terminate. This means the Generator will be garbage collected and no more observation will take place.Another benefit of the pull approach is that we can describe our control flow using a familiar synchronous style. For example, suppose we want to implement a login flow with two actions: LOGIN and LOGOUT. Using takeEvery (or redux-thunk), we'll have to write two separate tasks (or thunks): one for LOGIN and the other for LOGOUT.The result is that our logic is now spread in two places. In order for someone reading our code to understand it, they would have to read the source of the two handlers and make the link between the logic in both in their head. In other words, it means they would have to rebuild the model of the flow in their head by rearranging mentally the logic placed in various places of the code in the correct order.Using the pull model, we can write our flow in the same place instead of handling the same action repeatedly.function* loginFlow() {\n  while (true) {\n    yield take('LOGIN')\n    // ... perform the login logic\n    yield take('LOGOUT')\n    // ... perform the logout logic\n  }\n}\nThe loginFlow Saga more clearly conveys the expected action sequence. It knows that the LOGIN action should always be followed by a LOGOUT action, and that LOGOUT is always followed by a LOGIN (a good UI should always enforce a consistent order of the actions, by hiding or disabling unexpected actions)."},"docs/advanced/NonBlockingCalls.html":{"url":"docs/advanced/NonBlockingCalls.html","title":"3.2 Non blocking calls","keywords":"","body":"Non-blocking callsIn the previous section, we saw how the take Effect allows us to better describe a non-trivial flow in a central place.Revisiting the login flow example:function* loginFlow() {\n  while (true) {\n    yield take('LOGIN')\n    // ... perform the login logic\n    yield take('LOGOUT')\n    // ... perform the logout logic\n  }\n}\nLet's complete the example and implement the actual login/logout logic. Suppose we have an API which permits us to authorize the user on a remote server. If the authorization is successful, the server will return an authorization token which will be stored by our application using DOM storage (assume our API provides another service for DOM storage).When the user logs out, we'll simply delete the authorization token stored previously.First trySo far we have all needed Effects in order to implement the above flow. We can wait for specific actions in the store using the take Effect. We can make asynchronous calls using the call Effect. Finally, we can dispatch actions to the store using the put Effect.So let's give it a try:Note: the code below has a subtle issue. Make sure to read the section until the end.import { take, call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport Api from '...'\n\nfunction* authorize(user, password) {\n  try {\n    const token = yield call(Api.authorize, user, password)\n    yield put({type: 'LOGIN_SUCCESS', token})\n    return token\n  } catch(error) {\n    yield put({type: 'LOGIN_ERROR', error})\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* loginFlow() {\n  while (true) {\n    const {user, password} = yield take('LOGIN_REQUEST')\n    const token = yield call(authorize, user, password)\n    if (token) {\n      yield call(Api.storeItem, {token})\n      yield take('LOGOUT')\n      yield call(Api.clearItem, 'token')\n    }\n  }\n}\nFirst we created a separate Generator authorize which will perform the actual API call and notify the Store upon success.The loginFlow implements its entire flow inside a while (true) loop, which means once we reach the last step in the flow (LOGOUT) we start a new iteration by waiting for a new LOGIN_REQUEST action.loginFlow first waits for a LOGIN_REQUEST action. Then retrieves the credentials in the action payload (user and password) and makes a call to the authorize task.As you noted, call isn't only for invoking functions returning Promises. We can also use it to invoke other Generator functions. In the above example, loginFlow will wait for authorize until it terminates and returns (i.e. after performing the api call, dispatching the action and then returning the token to loginFlow).If the API call succeeds, authorize will dispatch a LOGIN_SUCCESS action then return the fetched token. If it results in an error,  it'll dispatch a LOGIN_ERROR action.If the call to authorize is successful, loginFlow will store the returned token in the DOM storage and wait for a LOGOUT action. When the user logouts, we remove the stored token and wait for a new user login.In the case of authorize failed, it'll return an undefined value, which will cause loginFlow to skip the previous process and wait for a new LOGIN_REQUEST action.Observe how the entire logic is stored in one place. A new developer reading our code doesn't have to travel between various places in order to understand the control flow. It's like reading a synchronous algorithm: steps are laid out in their natural order. And we have functions which call other functions and wait for their results.But there is still a subtle issue with the above approachSuppose that when the loginFlow is waiting for the following call to resolve:function* loginFlow() {\n  while (true) {\n    // ...\n    try {\n      const token = yield call(authorize, user, password)\n      // ...\n    }\n    // ...\n  }\n}\nThe user clicks on the Logout button causing a LOGOUT action to be dispatched.The following example illustrates the hypothetical sequence of the events:UI                              loginFlow\n--------------------------------------------------------\nLOGIN_REQUEST...................call authorize.......... waiting to resolve\n........................................................\n........................................................\nLOGOUT.................................................. missed!\n........................................................\n................................authorize returned...... dispatch a `LOGIN_SUCCESS`!!\n........................................................\nWhen loginFlow is blocked on the authorize call, an eventual LOGOUT occurring in between the call and the response will be missed, because loginFlow hasn't yet performed the yield take('LOGOUT').The problem with the above code is that call is a blocking Effect. i.e. the Generator can't perform/handle anything else until the call terminates. But in our case we do not only want loginFlow to execute the authorization call, but also watch for an eventual LOGOUT action that may occur in the middle of this call. That's because LOGOUT is concurrent to the authorize call.So what's needed is some way to start authorize without blocking so loginFlow can continue and watch for an eventual/concurrent LOGOUT action.To express non-blocking calls, the library provides another Effect: fork. When we fork a task, the task is started in the background and the caller can continue its flow without waiting for the forked task to terminate.So in order for loginFlow to not miss a concurrent LOGOUT, we must not call the authorize task, instead we have to fork it.import { fork, call, take, put } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* loginFlow() {\n  while (true) {\n    ...\n    try {\n      // non-blocking call, what's the returned value here ?\n      const ?? = yield fork(authorize, user, password)\n      ...\n    }\n    ...\n  }\n}\nThe issue now is since our authorize action is started in the background, we can't get the token result (because we'd have to wait for it). So we need to move the token storage operation into the authorize task.import { fork, call, take, put } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport Api from '...'\n\nfunction* authorize(user, password) {\n  try {\n    const token = yield call(Api.authorize, user, password)\n    yield put({type: 'LOGIN_SUCCESS', token})\n    yield call(Api.storeItem, {token})\n  } catch(error) {\n    yield put({type: 'LOGIN_ERROR', error})\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* loginFlow() {\n  while (true) {\n    const {user, password} = yield take('LOGIN_REQUEST')\n    yield fork(authorize, user, password)\n    yield take(['LOGOUT', 'LOGIN_ERROR'])\n    yield call(Api.clearItem, 'token')\n  }\n}\nWe're also doing yield take(['LOGOUT', 'LOGIN_ERROR']). It means we are watching for 2 concurrent actions:If the authorize task succeeds before the user logs out, it'll dispatch a LOGIN_SUCCESS action, then terminate. Our loginFlow saga will then wait only for a future LOGOUT action (because LOGIN_ERROR will never happen).\nIf the authorize fails before the user logs out, it will dispatch a LOGIN_ERROR action, then terminate. So loginFlow will take the LOGIN_ERROR before the LOGOUT then it will enter in a another while iteration and will wait for the next LOGIN_REQUEST action.\nIf the user logs out before the authorize terminate, then loginFlow will take a LOGOUT action and also wait for the next LOGIN_REQUEST.\nNote the call for Api.clearItem is supposed to be idempotent. It'll have no effect if no token was stored by the authorize call. loginFlow makes sure no token will be in the storage before waiting for the next login.But we're not yet done. If we take a LOGOUT in the middle of an API call, we have to cancel the authorize process, otherwise we'll have 2 concurrent tasks evolving in parallel: The authorize task will continue running and upon a successful (resp. failed) result, will dispatch a LOGIN_SUCCESS (resp. a LOGIN_ERROR) action leading to an inconsistent state.In order to cancel a forked task, we use a dedicated Effect cancelimport { take, put, call, fork, cancel } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\n// ...\n\nfunction* loginFlow() {\n  while (true) {\n    const {user, password} = yield take('LOGIN_REQUEST')\n    // fork return a Task object\n    const task = yield fork(authorize, user, password)\n    const action = yield take(['LOGOUT', 'LOGIN_ERROR'])\n    if (action.type === 'LOGOUT')\n      yield cancel(task)\n    yield call(Api.clearItem, 'token')\n  }\n}\nyield fork results in a Task Object. We assign the returned object into a local constant task. Later if we take a LOGOUT action, we pass that task to the cancel Effect. If the task is still running, it'll be aborted. If the task has already completed then nothing will happen and the cancellation will result in a no-op. And finally, if the task completed with an error, then we do nothing, because we know the task already completed.We are almost done (concurrency is not that easy; you have to take it seriously).Suppose that when we receive a LOGIN_REQUEST action, our reducer sets some isLoginPending flag to true so it can display some message or spinner in the UI. If we get a LOGOUT in the middle of an API call and abort the task by simply killing it (i.e. the task is stopped right away), then we may end up again with an inconsistent state. We'll still have isLoginPending set to true and our reducer will be waiting for an outcome action (LOGIN_SUCCESS or LOGIN_ERROR).Fortunately, the cancel Effect won't brutally kill our authorize task, it'll instead give it a chance to perform its cleanup logic. The cancelled task can handle any cancellation logic (as well as any other type of completion) in its finally block. Since a finally block execute on any type of completion (normal return, error, or forced cancellation), there is an Effect cancelled which you can use if you want handle cancellation in a special way:import { take, call, put, cancelled } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport Api from '...'\n\nfunction* authorize(user, password) {\n  try {\n    const token = yield call(Api.authorize, user, password)\n    yield put({type: 'LOGIN_SUCCESS', token})\n    yield call(Api.storeItem, {token})\n    return token\n  } catch(error) {\n    yield put({type: 'LOGIN_ERROR', error})\n  } finally {\n    if (yield cancelled()) {\n      // ... put special cancellation handling code here\n    }\n  }\n}\nYou may have noticed that we haven't done anything about clearing our isLoginPending state. For that, there are at least two possible solutions:dispatch a dedicated action RESET_LOGIN_PENDING\n\nmore simply, make the reducer clear the isLoginPending on a LOGOUT action\n\n"},"docs/advanced/RunningTasksInParallel.html":{"url":"docs/advanced/RunningTasksInParallel.html","title":"3.3 Running tasks in parallel","keywords":"","body":"Running Tasks In ParallelThe yield statement is great for representing asynchronous control flow in a simple and linear style, but we also need to do things in parallel.

This leads to some duplication in the test code as well as the overhead of the duplicated execution. We don't want to execute a nested generator but only make sure the call to it was issued with the right argument.\nMore importantly, yield* allows only for sequential composition of tasks, so you can only yield* to one generator at a time.\nYou can simply use yield to start one or more subtasks in parallel. When yielding a call to a generator, the Saga will wait for the generator to terminate before progressing, then resume with the returned value (or throws if an error propagates from the subtask).function* fetchPosts() {\n  yield put(actions.requestPosts())\n  const products = yield call(fetchApi, '/products')\n  yield put(actions.receivePosts(products))\n}\n\nfunction* watchFetch() {\n  while (yield take(FETCH_POSTS)) {\n    yield call(fetchPosts) // waits for the fetchPosts task to terminate\n  }\n}\nYielding to an array of nested generators will start all the sub-generators in parallel, wait\nfor them to finish, then resume with all the resultsfunction* mainSaga(getState) {\n  const results = yield all([call(task1), call(task2), ...])\n  yield put(showResults(results))\n}\nIn fact, yielding Sagas is no different than yielding other effects (future actions, timeouts, etc).

In this section we'll review cancellation in more detail.Once a task is forked, you can abort its execution using yield cancel(task).To see how it works, let's consider a simple example: A background sync which can be started/stopped by some UI commands. Upon receiving a START_BACKGROUND_SYNC action, we fork a background task that will periodically sync some data from a remote server.The task will execute continually until a STOP_BACKGROUND_SYNC action is triggered. Then we cancel the background task and wait again for the next START_BACKGROUND_SYNC action.import { take, put, call, fork, cancel, cancelled } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport { delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { someApi, actions } from 'somewhere'\n\nfunction* bgSync() {\n  try {\n    while (true) {\n      yield put(actions.requestStart())\n      const result = yield call(someApi)\n      yield put(actions.requestSuccess(result))\n      yield call(delay, 5000)\n    }\n  } finally {\n    if (yield cancelled())\n      yield put(actions.requestFailure('Sync cancelled!'))\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* main() {\n  while ( yield take(START_BACKGROUND_SYNC) ) {\n    // starts the task in the background\n    const bgSyncTask = yield fork(bgSync)\n\n    // wait for the user stop action\n    yield take(STOP_BACKGROUND_SYNC)\n    // user clicked stop. cancel the background task\n    // this will cause the forked bgSync task to jump into its finally block\n    yield cancel(bgSyncTask)\n  }\n}\nIn the above example, cancellation of bgSyncTask will cause the Generator to jump to the finally block. Here you can use yield cancelled() to check if the Generator has been cancelled or not.Cancelling a running task will also cancel the current Effect where the task is blocked at the moment of cancellation.For example, suppose that at a certain point in an application's lifetime, we have this pending call chain:function* main() {\n  const task = yield fork(subtask)\n  ...\n  // later\n  yield cancel(task)\n}\n\nfunction* subtask() {\n  ...\n  yield call(subtask2) // currently blocked on this call\n  ...\n}\n\nfunction* subtask2() {\n  ...\n  yield call(someApi) // currently blocked on this call\n  ...\n}\nyield cancel(task) triggers a cancellation on subtask, which in turn triggers a cancellation on subtask2.So we saw that Cancellation propagates downward (in contrast returned values and uncaught errors propagates upward). You can see it as a contract between the caller (which invokes the async operation) and the callee (the invoked operation). The callee is responsible for performing the operation. If it has completed (either success or error) the outcome propagates up to its caller and eventually to the caller of the caller and so on. That is, callees are responsible for completing the flow.Now if the callee is still pending and the caller decides to cancel the operation, it triggers a kind of a signal that propagates down to the callee (and possibly to any deep operations called by the callee itself). All deeply pending operations will be cancelled.There is another direction where the cancellation propagates to as well: the joiners of a task (those blocked on a yield join(task)) will also be cancelled if the joined task is cancelled. Similarly, any potential callers of those joiners will be cancelled as well (because they are blocked on an operation that has been cancelled from outside).Testing generators with fork effectWhen fork is called it starts the task in the background and also returns task object like we have learned previously. When testing this we have to use utility function createMockTask. Object returned from this function should be passed to next next call after fork test. Mock task can then be passed to cancel for example. Here is test for main generator which is on top of this page.import { createMockTask } from 'redux-saga/utils';\n\ndescribe('main', () => {\n  const generator = main();\n\n  it('waits for start action', () => {\n    const expectedYield = take(START_BACKGROUND_SYNC);\n    expect(generator.next().value).to.deep.equal(expectedYield);\n  });\n\n  it('forks the service', () => {\n    const expectedYield = fork(bgSync);\n    const mockedAction = { type: 'START_BACKGROUND_SYNC' };\n    expect(generator.next(mockedAction).value).to.deep.equal(expectedYield);\n  });\n\n  it('waits for stop action and then cancels the service', () => {\n    const mockTask = createMockTask();\n\n    const expectedTakeYield = take(STOP_BACKGROUND_SYNC);\n    expect(generator.next(mockTask).value).to.deep.equal(expectedTakeYield);\n\n    const expectedCancelYield = cancel(mockTask);\n    expect(generator.next().value).to.deep.equal(expectedCancelYield);\n  });\n});\nYou can also use mock task's functions setRunning, setResult and setError to set mock task's state. For example mockTask.setRunning(false).NoteIt's important to remember that yield cancel(task) doesn't wait for the cancelled task to finish (i.e. to perform its finally block). The cancel effect behaves like fork. It returns as soon as the cancel was initiated. Once cancelled, a task should normally return as soon as it finishes its cleanup logic.Automatic cancellationBesides manual cancellation there are cases where cancellation is triggered automaticallyIn a race effect. All race competitors, except the winner, are automatically cancelled.\nIn a parallel effect (yield all([...])). The parallel effect is rejected as soon as one of the sub-effects is rejected (as implied by Promise.all). In this case, all the other sub-effects are automatically cancelled.\n"},"docs/advanced/ForkModel.html":{"url":"docs/advanced/ForkModel.html","title":"3.8 redux-saga's fork model","keywords":"","body":"redux-saga's fork modelIn redux-saga you can dynamically fork tasks that execute in the background using 2 Effectsfork is used to create attached forks\n\nspawn is used to create detached forks\n\nAttached forks (using fork)Attached forks remains attached to their parent by the following rulesCompletionA Saga terminates only after\nIt terminates its own body of instructions\n\nAll attached forks are themselves terminated\n\n\nFor example say we have the followingimport { delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { fork, call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport api from './somewhere/api' // app specific\nimport { receiveData } from './somewhere/actions' // app specific\n\nfunction* fetchAll() {\n  const task1 = yield fork(fetchResource, 'users')\n  const task2 = yield fork(fetchResource, 'comments')\n  yield call(delay, 1000)\n}\n\nfunction* fetchResource(resource) {\n  const {data} = yield call(api.fetch, resource)\n  yield put(receiveData(data))\n}\n\nfunction* main() {\n  yield call(fetchAll)\n}\ncall(fetchAll) will terminate after:The fetchAll body itself terminates, this means all 3 effects are performed. Since fork effects are non blocking, the\ntask will block on call(delay, 1000)\nThe 2 forked tasks terminate, i.e. after fetching the required resources and putting the corresponding receiveData actions\nSo the whole task will block until a delay of 1000 millisecond passed and both task1 and task2 finished their business.Say for example, the delay of 1000 milliseconds elapsed and the 2 tasks haven't yet finished, then fetchAll will still wait\nfor all forked tasks to finish before terminating the whole task.The attentive reader might have noticed the fetchAll saga could be rewritten using the parallel Effectfunction* fetchAll() {\n  yield all([\n    call(fetchResource, 'users'),     // task1\n    call(fetchResource, 'comments'),  // task2,\n    call(delay, 1000)\n  ])\n}\nIn fact, attached forks shares the same semantics with the parallel Effect:We're executing tasks in parallel\n\nThe parent will terminate after all launched tasks terminate\n\nAnd this applies for all other semantics as well (error and cancellation propagation). You can understand how\nattached forks behave by simply considering it as a dynamic parallel Effect.Error propagationFollowing the same analogy, Let's examine in detail how errors are handled in parallel Effectsfor example, let's say we have this Effectyield all([\n  call(fetchResource, 'users'),\n  call(fetchResource, 'comments'),\n  call(delay, 1000)\n])\nThe above effect will fail as soon as any one of the 3 child Effects fails. Furthermore, the uncaught error will cause\nthe parallel Effect to cancel all the other pending Effects. So for example if call(fetchResource, 'users') raises an\nuncaught error, the parallel Effect will cancel the 2 other tasks (if they are still pending) then aborts itself with the\nsame error from the failed call.Similarly for attached forks, a Saga aborts as soon asIts main body of instructions throws an error\nAn uncaught error was raised by one of its attached forks\nSo in the previous example//... imports\n\nfunction* fetchAll() {\n  const task1 = yield fork(fetchResource, 'users')\n  const task2 = yield fork(fetchResource, 'comments')\n  yield call(delay, 1000)\n}\n\nfunction* fetchResource(resource) {\n  const {data} = yield call(api.fetch, resource)\n  yield put(receiveData(data))\n}\n\nfunction* main() {\n  try {\n    yield call(fetchAll)\n  } catch (e) {\n    // handle fetchAll errors\n  }\n}\nIf at a moment, for example, fetchAll is blocked on the call(delay, 1000) Effect, and say, task1 failed, then the whole\nfetchAll task will fail causingCancellation of all other pending tasks. This includes:The main task (the body of fetchAll): cancelling it means cancelling the current Effect call(delay, 1000)\n\nThe other forked tasks which are still pending. i.e. task2 in our example.\n\n\nThe call(fetchAll) will raise itself an error which will be caught in the catch body of main\nNote we're able to catch the error from call(fetchAll) inside main only because we're using a blocking call. And that\nwe can't catch the error directly from fetchAll. This is a rule of thumb, you can't catch errors from forked tasks. A failure\nin an attached fork will cause the forking parent to abort (Just like there is no way to catch an error inside a parallel Effect, only from\noutside by blocking on the parallel Effect).CancellationCancelling a Saga causes the cancellation of:The main task this means cancelling the current Effect where the Saga is blocked\nAll attached forks that are still executing\nWIPDetached forks (using spawn)Detached forks live in their own execution context.

The watchRequests saga is using fork to avoid blocking and thus not missing any action from the store. A handleRequest task is created on each REQUEST action. So if there are many actions fired at a rapid rate there can be many handleRequest tasks executing concurrently.Imagine now that our requirement is as follows: we want to process REQUEST serially. If we have at any moment four actions, we want to handle the first REQUEST action, then only after finishing this action we process the second action and so on...So we want to queue all non-processed actions, and once we're done with processing the current request, we get the next message from the queue.Redux-Saga provides a little helper Effect actionChannel, which can handle this for us. Let's see how we can rewrite the previous example with it:import { take, actionChannel, call, ... } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchRequests() {\n  // 1- Create a channel for request actions\n  const requestChan = yield actionChannel('REQUEST')\n  while (true) {\n    // 2- take from the channel\n    const {payload} = yield take(requestChan)\n    // 3- Note that we're using a blocking call\n    yield call(handleRequest, payload)\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* handleRequest(payload) { ... }\nThe first thing is to create the action channel. We use yield actionChannel(pattern) where pattern is interpreted using the same rules we mentioned previously with take(pattern). The difference between the 2 forms is that actionChannel can buffer incoming messages if the Saga is not yet ready to take them (e.g. blocked on an API call).Next is the yield take(requestChan). Besides usage with a pattern to take specific actions from the Redux Store, take can also be used with channels (above we created a channel object from specific Redux actions). The take will block the Saga until a message is available on the channel. The take may also resume immediately if there is a message stored in the underlying buffer.The important thing to note is how we're using a blocking call. The Saga will remain blocked until call(handleRequest) returns. But meanwhile, if other REQUEST actions are dispatched while the Saga is still blocked, they will queued internally by requestChan. When the Saga resumes from call(handleRequest) and executes the next yield take(requestChan), the take will resolve with the queued message.By default, actionChannel buffers all incoming messages without limit. If you want a more control over the buffering, you can supply a Buffer argument to the effect creator. Redux-Saga provides some common buffers (none, dropping, sliding) but you can also supply your own buffer implementation. See API docs for more details.For example if you want to handle only the most recent five items you can use:import { buffers } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { actionChannel } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchRequests() {\n  const requestChan = yield actionChannel('REQUEST', buffers.sliding(5))\n  ...\n}\nUsing the eventChannel factory to connect to external eventsLike actionChannel (Effect), eventChannel (a factory function, not an Effect) creates a Channel for events but from event sources other than the Redux Store.This simple example creates a Channel from an interval:import { eventChannel, END } from 'redux-saga'\n\nfunction countdown(secs) {\n  return eventChannel(emitter => {\n      const iv = setInterval(() => {\n        secs -= 1\n        if (secs > 0) {\n          emitter(secs)\n        } else {\n          // this causes the channel to close\n          emitter(END)\n        }\n      }, 1000);\n      // The subscriber must return an unsubscribe function\n      return () => {\n        clearInterval(iv)\n      }\n    }\n  )\n}\nThe first argument in eventChannel is a subscriber function. The role of the subscriber is to initialize the external event source (above using setInterval), then routes all incoming events from the source to the channel by invoking the supplied emitter. In the above example we're invoking emitter on each second.Note: You need to sanitize your event sources as to not pass null or undefined through the event channel. While it's fine to pass numbers through, we'd recommend structuring your event channel data like your redux actions. { number } over number.Note also the invocation emitter(END). We use this to notify any channel consumer that the channel has been closed, meaning no other messages will come through this channel.Let's see how we can use this channel from our Saga. (This is taken from the cancellable-counter example in the repo.)import { take, put, call } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport { eventChannel, END } from 'redux-saga'\n\n// creates an event Channel from an interval of seconds\nfunction countdown(seconds) { ... }\n\nexport function* saga() {\n  const chan = yield call(countdown, value)\n  try {    \n    while (true) {\n      // take(END) will cause the saga to terminate by jumping to the finally block\n      let seconds = yield take(chan)\n      console.log(`countdown: ${seconds}`)\n    }\n  } finally {\n    console.log('countdown terminated')\n  }\n}\nSo the Saga is yielding a take(chan). This causes the Saga to block until a message is put on the channel. In our example above, it corresponds to when we invoke emitter(secs). Note also we're executing the whole while (true) {...} loop inside a try/finally block. When the interval terminates, the countdown function closes the event channel by invoking emitter(END). Closing a channel has the effect of terminating all Sagas blocked on a take from that channel. In our example, terminating the Saga will cause it to jump to its finally block (if provided, otherwise the Saga simply terminates).The subscriber returns an unsubscribe function. This is used by the channel to unsubscribe before the event source complete. Inside a Saga consuming messages from an event channel, if we want to exit early before the event source complete (e.g. Saga has been cancelled) you can call chan.close() to close the channel and unsubscribe from the source.For example, we can make our Saga support cancellation:import { take, put, call, cancelled } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport { eventChannel, END } from 'redux-saga'\n\n// creates an event Channel from an interval of seconds\nfunction countdown(seconds) { ... }\n\nexport function* saga() {\n  const chan = yield call(countdown, value)\n  try {    \n    while (true) {\n      let seconds = yield take(chan)\n      console.log(`countdown: ${seconds}`)\n    }\n  } finally {\n    if (yield cancelled()) {\n      chan.close()\n      console.log('countdown cancelled')\n    }    \n  }\n}\nHere is another example of how you can use event channels to pass WebSocket events into your saga (e.g.: using socket.io library).\nSuppose you are waiting for a server message ping then reply with a pong message after some delay.import { take, put, call, apply } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport { eventChannel, delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { createWebSocketConnection } from './socketConnection'\n\n// this function creates an event channel from a given socket\n// Setup subscription to incoming `ping` events\nfunction createSocketChannel(socket) {\n  // `eventChannel` takes a subscriber function\n  // the subscriber function takes an `emit` argument to put messages onto the channel\n  return eventChannel(emit => {\n\n    const pingHandler = (event) => {\n      // puts event payload into the channel\n      // this allows a Saga to take this payload from the returned channel\n      emit(event.payload)\n    }\n\n    // setup the subscription\n    socket.on('ping', pingHandler)\n\n    // the subscriber must return an unsubscribe function\n    // this will be invoked when the saga calls `channel.close` method\n    const unsubscribe = () => {\n      socket.off('ping', pingHandler)\n    }\n\n    return unsubscribe\n  })\n}\n\n// reply with a `pong` message by invoking `socket.emit('pong')`\nfunction* pong(socket) {\n  yield call(delay, 5000)\n  yield apply(socket, socket.emit, ['pong']) // call `emit` as a method with `socket` as context\n}\n\nexport function* watchOnPings() {\n  const socket = yield call(createWebSocketConnection)\n  const socketChannel = yield call(createSocketChannel, socket)\n\n  while (true) {\n    const payload = yield take(socketChannel)\n    yield put({ type: INCOMING_PONG_PAYLOAD, payload })\n    yield fork(pong, socket)\n  }\n}\nNote: messages on an eventChannel are not buffered by default. You have to provide a buffer to the eventChannel factory in order to specify buffering strategy for the channel (e.g. eventChannel(subscriber, buffer)).\nSee the API docs for more info.Using channels to communicate between SagasBesides action channels and event channels. You can also directly create channels which are not connected to any source by default. You can then manually put on the channel. This is handy when you want to use a channel to communicate between sagas.To illustrate, let's review the former example of request handling.import { take, fork, ... } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchRequests() {\n  while (true) {\n    const {payload} = yield take('REQUEST')\n    yield fork(handleRequest, payload)\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* handleRequest(payload) { ... }\nWe saw that the watch-and-fork pattern allows handling multiple requests simultaneously, without limit on the number of worker tasks executing concurrently. Then, we used the actionChannel effect to limit the concurrency to one task at a time.So let's say that our requirement is to have a maximum of three tasks executing at the same time. When we get a request and there are less than three tasks executing, we process the request immediately, otherwise we queue the task and wait for one of the three slots to become free.Below is an example of a solution using channels:import { channel } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { take, fork, ... } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchRequests() {\n  // create a channel to queue incoming requests\n  const chan = yield call(channel)\n\n  // create 3 worker 'threads'\n  for (var i = 0; i \nIn the above example, we create a channel using the channel factory. We get back a channel which by default buffers all messages we put on it (unless there is a pending taker, in which the taker is resumed immediately with the message).The watchRequests saga then forks three worker sagas. Note the created channel is supplied to all forked sagas. watchRequests will use this channel to dispatch work to the three worker sagas. On each REQUEST action the Saga will simply put the payload on the channel. The payload will then be taken by any free worker. Otherwise it will be queued by the channel until a worker Saga is ready to take it.All the three workers run a typical while loop. On each iteration, a worker will take the next request, or will block until a message is available. Note that this mechanism provides an automatic load-balancing between the 3 workers. Rapid workers are not slowed down by slow workers."},"docs/recipes/":{"url":"docs/recipes/","title":"4. Recipes","keywords":"","body":"RecipesThrottlingYou can throttle a sequence of dispatched actions by using a handy built-in throttle helper. For example, suppose the UI fires an INPUT_CHANGED action while the user is typing in a text field.import { throttle } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* handleInput(input) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nfunction* watchInput() {\n  yield throttle(500, 'INPUT_CHANGED', handleInput)\n}\nBy using this helper the watchInput won't start a new handleInput task for 500ms, but in the same time it will still be accepting the latest INPUT_CHANGED actions into its underlaying buffer, so it'll miss all INPUT_CHANGED actions happening in-between. This ensures that the Saga will take at most one INPUT_CHANGED action during each period of 500ms and still be able to process trailing action.DebouncingTo debounce a sequence, put the built-in delay helper in the forked task:\nimport { delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { call, cancel, fork, take } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* handleInput(input) {\n  // debounce by 500ms\n  yield call(delay, 500)\n  ...\n}\n\nfunction* watchInput() {\n  let task\n  while (true) {\n    const { input } = yield take('INPUT_CHANGED')\n    if (task) {\n      yield cancel(task)\n    }\n    task = yield fork(handleInput, input)\n  }\n}\nThe delay function implements a simple debounce using a Promise.const delay = (ms) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms))\nIn the above example handleInput waits for 500ms before performing its logic. If the user types something during this period we'll get more INPUT_CHANGED actions. Since handleInput will still be blocked in the delay call, it'll be cancelled by watchInput before it can start performing its logic.Example above could be rewritten with redux-saga takeLatest helper:\nimport { delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { call, takeLatest } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* handleInput({ input }) {\n  // debounce by 500ms\n  yield call(delay, 500)\n  ...\n}\n\nfunction* watchInput() {\n  // will cancel current running handleInput task\n  yield takeLatest('INPUT_CHANGED', handleInput);\n}\nRetrying XHR callsTo retry a XHR call for a specific amount of times, use a for loop with a delay:\nimport { delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { call, put, take } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* updateApi(data) {\n  for(let i = 0; i \nIn the above example the apiRequest will be retried for 5 times, with a delay of 2 seconds in between. After the 5th failure, the exception thrown will get caught by the parent saga, which will dispatch the UPDATE_ERROR action.If you want unlimited retries, then the for loop can be replaced with a while (true). Also instead of take you can use takeLatest, so only the last request will be retried. By adding an UPDATE_RETRY action in the error handling, we can inform the user that the update was not successfull but it will be retried.import { delay } from 'redux-saga'\n\nfunction* updateApi(data) {\n  while (true) {\n    try {\n      const apiResponse = yield call(apiRequest, { data });\n      return apiResponse;\n    } catch(error) {\n      yield put({\n        type: 'UPDATE_RETRY',\n        error\n      })\n      yield call(delay, 2000);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* updateResource({ data }) {\n  const apiResponse = yield call(updateApi, data);\n  yield put({\n    type: 'UPDATE_SUCCESS',\n    payload: apiResponse.body,\n  });\n}\n\nexport function* watchUpdateResource() {\n  yield takeLatest('UPDATE_START', updateResource);\n}\n\nUndoThe ability to undo respects the user by allowing the action to happen smoothly\nfirst and foremost before assuming they don't know what they are doing. GoodUI\nThe redux documentation describes a\nrobust way to implement an undo based on modifying the reducer to contain past, present,\nand future state.  There is even a library redux-undo that\ncreates a higher order reducer to do most of the heavy lifting for the developer.However, this method comes with overhead because it stores references to the previous state(s) of the application.Using redux-saga's delay and race we can implement a simple, one-time undo without enhancing\nour reducer or storing the previous state.import { take, put, call, spawn, race } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport { delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { updateThreadApi, actions } from 'somewhere'\n\nfunction* onArchive(action) {\n\n  const { threadId } = action\n  const undoId = `UNDO_ARCHIVE_${threadId}`\n\n  const thread = { id: threadId, archived: true }\n\n  // show undo UI element, and provide a key to communicate\n  yield put(actions.showUndo(undoId))\n\n  // optimistically mark the thread as `archived`\n  yield put(actions.updateThread(thread))\n\n  // allow the user 5 seconds to perform undo.\n  // after 5 seconds, 'archive' will be the winner of the race-condition\n  const { undo, archive } = yield race({\n    undo: take(action => action.type === 'UNDO' && action.undoId === undoId),\n    archive: call(delay, 5000)\n  })\n\n  // hide undo UI element, the race condition has an answer\n  yield put(actions.hideUndo(undoId))\n\n  if (undo) {\n    // revert thread to previous state\n    yield put(actions.updateThread({ id: threadId, archived: false }))\n  } else if (archive) {\n    // make the API call to apply the changes remotely\n    yield call(updateThreadApi, thread)\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* main() {\n  while (true) {\n    // wait for an ARCHIVE_THREAD to happen\n    const action = yield take('ARCHIVE_THREAD')\n    // use spawn to execute onArchive in a non-blocking fashion, which also\n    // prevents cancellation when main saga gets cancelled.\n    // This helps us in keeping state in sync between server and client\n    yield spawn(onArchive, action)\n  }\n}\n"},"docs/ExternalResources.html":{"url":"docs/ExternalResources.html","title":"5.

Unless you yield it for the middleware to execute, the while loop will behave like a regular while loop, and freeze your application.Adding yield will pause the generator and return control to the Redux Saga middleware which will execute the effect. In case of take(), Redux Saga will wait for the next action matching the pattern, and only then will resume the generator.To fix the example above, simply yield the effect returned by take():import { take } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* logActions() {\n  while (true) {\n    const action = yield take() // correct\n    console.log(action)\n  }\n}\nMy Saga is missing dispatched actionsMake sure the Saga is not blocked on some effect.

Currently supported options are:sagaMonitor : SagaMonitor - If a Saga Monitor is provided, the middleware will deliver monitoring events to the monitor.\nemitter : Used to feed actions from redux to redux-saga (through redux middleware). Emitter is a higher order function, which takes a builtin emitter and returns another emitter.ExampleIn the following example we create an emitter which \"unpacks\" array of actions and emits individual actions extracted from the array. createSagaMiddleware({\n   emitter: emit => action => {\n    if (Array.isArray(action)) {\n      action.forEach(emit);\n      return\n    }\n    emit(action);\n   }\n });\nlogger : Function -  defines a custom logger for the middleware. By default, the middleware logs all errors and\nwarnings to the console. This option tells the middleware to send errors/warnings to the provided logger instead. The logger is called with the params (level, ...args). The 1st indicates the level of the log ('info', 'warning' or 'error'). The rest corresponds to the following arguments (You can use args.join(' ') to concatenate all args into a single String).\n\n\nonError : Function - if provided, the middleware will call it with uncaught errors from Sagas. useful for sending uncaught exceptions to error tracking services.\n\nExampleBelow we will create a function configureStore which will enhance the Store with a new method runSaga. Then in our main module, we will use the method to start the root Saga of the application.configureStore.jsimport createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga'\nimport reducer from './path/to/reducer'\n\nexport default function configureStore(initialState) {\n  // Note: passing middleware as the last argument to createStore requires redux@>=3.1.0\n  const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware()\n  return {\n    ...createStore(reducer, initialState, applyMiddleware(/* other middleware, */sagaMiddleware)),\n    runSaga: sagaMiddleware.run\n  }\n}\nmain.jsimport configureStore from './configureStore'\nimport rootSaga from './sagas'\n// ... other imports\n\nconst store = configureStore()\nstore.runSaga(rootSaga)\nNotesSee below for more information on the sagaMiddleware.run method.middleware.run(saga, ...args)Dynamically run saga. Can be used to run Sagas only after the applyMiddleware phase.saga: Function: a Generator function\n\nargs: Array: arguments to be provided to saga\n\nThe method returns a Task descriptor.Notessaga must be a function which returns a Generator Object. The middleware will then iterate over the Generator and execute all yielded Effects.saga may also start other sagas using the various Effects provided by the library. The iteration process described below is also applied to all child sagas.In the first iteration, the middleware invokes the next() method to retrieve the next Effect. The middleware then executes the yielded Effect as specified by the Effects API below. Meanwhile, the Generator will be suspended until the effect execution terminates. Upon receiving the result of the execution, the middleware calls next(result) on the Generator passing it the retrieved result as an argument. This process is repeated until the Generator terminates normally or by throwing some error.If the execution results in an error (as specified by each Effect creator) then the throw(error) method of the Generator is called instead. If the Generator function defines a try/catch surrounding the current yield instruction, then the catch block will be invoked by the underlying Generator runtime. The runtime will also invoke any corresponding finally block.In the case a Saga is cancelled (either manually or using the provided Effects), the middleware will invoke return() method of the Generator. This will cause the Generator to skip directly to the finally block.Saga HelpersNote: the following functions are helper functions built on top of the Effect creators\nbelow.takeEvery(pattern, saga, ...args)Spawns a saga on each action dispatched to the Store that matches pattern.pattern: String | Array | Function - for more information see docs for take(pattern)\nsaga: Function - a Generator function\nargs: Array - arguments to be passed to the started task. takeEvery will add the incoming action to the argument list (i.e. the action will be the last argument provided to saga)\nExampleIn the following example, we create a simple task fetchUser. We use takeEvery to start a new fetchUser task on each dispatched USER_REQUESTED action:import { takeEvery } from `redux-saga/effects`\n\nfunction* fetchUser(action) {\n  ...\n}\n\nfunction* watchFetchUser() {\n  yield takeEvery('USER_REQUESTED', fetchUser)\n}\nNotestakeEvery is a high-level API built using take and fork. Here is how the helper could be implemented using the low-level Effectsconst takeEvery = (patternOrChannel, saga, ...args) => fork(function*() {\n  while (true) {\n    const action = yield take(patternOrChannel)\n    yield fork(saga, ...args.concat(action))\n  }\n})\ntakeEvery allows concurrent actions to be handled. In the example above, when a USER_REQUESTED\naction is dispatched, a new fetchUser task is started even if a previous fetchUser is still pending\n(for example, the user clicks on a Load User button 2 consecutive times at a rapid rate, the 2nd\nclick will dispatch a USER_REQUESTED action while the fetchUser fired on the first one hasn't yet terminated)takeEvery doesn't handle out of order responses from tasks. There is no guarantee that the tasks will\ntermiate in the same order they were started. To handle out of order responses, you may consider takeLatest\nbelow.takeEvery(channel, saga, ...args)You can also pass in a channel as argument and the behaviour is the same as takeEvery(pattern, saga, ...args).takeLatest(pattern, saga, ...args)Spawns a saga on each action dispatched to the Store that matches pattern. And automatically cancels\nany previous saga task started previous if it's still running.Each time an action is dispatched to the store. And if this action matches pattern, takeLatest\nstarts a new saga task in the background. If a saga task was started previously (on the last action dispatched\nbefore the actual action), and if this task is still running, the task will be cancelled.pattern: String | Array | Function - for more information see docs for take(pattern)\nsaga: Function - a Generator function\nargs: Array - arguments to be passed to the started task. takeLatest will add the\nincoming action to the argument list (i.e. the action will be the last argument provided to saga)\nExampleIn the following example, we create a simple task fetchUser. We use takeLatest to\nstart a new fetchUser task on each dispatched USER_REQUESTED action. Since takeLatest\ncancels any pending task started previously, we ensure that if a user triggers multiple consecutive\nUSER_REQUESTED actions rapidly, we'll only conclude with the latest actionimport { takeLatest } from `redux-saga/effects`\n\nfunction* fetchUser(action) {\n  ...\n}\n\nfunction* watchLastFetchUser() {\n  yield takeLatest('USER_REQUESTED', fetchUser)\n}\nNotestakeLatest is a high-level API built using take and fork. Here is how the helper could be implemented using the low-level Effectsconst takeLatest = (patternOrChannel, saga, ...args) => fork(function*() {\n  let lastTask\n  while (true) {\n    const action = yield take(patternOrChannel)\n    if (lastTask) {\n      yield cancel(lastTask) // cancel is no-op if the task has already terminated\n    }\n    lastTask = yield fork(saga, ...args.concat(action))\n  }\n})\ntakeLatest(channel, saga, ...args)You can also pass in a channel as argument and the behaviour is the same as takeLatest(pattern, saga, ...args).throttle(ms, pattern, saga, ...args)Spawns a saga on an action dispatched to the Store that matches pattern. After spawning a task it's still accepting incoming actions into the underlaying buffer, keeping at most 1 (the most recent one), but in the same time holding up with spawning new task for ms milliseconds (hence its name - throttle). Purpose of this is to ignore incoming actions for a given period of time while processing a task.ms: Number - length of a time window in milliseconds during which actions will be ignored after the action starts processing\npattern: String | Array | Function - for more information see docs for take(pattern)\nsaga: Function - a Generator function\nargs: Array - arguments to be passed to the started task. throttle will add the\nincoming action to the argument list (i.e. the action will be the last argument provided to saga)\nExampleIn the following example, we create a simple task fetchAutocomplete. We use throttle to\nstart a new fetchAutocomplete task on dispatched FETCH_AUTOCOMPLETE action. However since throttle ignores consecutive FETCH_AUTOCOMPLETE for some time, we ensure that user won't flood our server with requests.import { call, put, throttle } from `redux-saga/effects`\n\nfunction* fetchAutocomplete(action) {\n  const autocompleteProposals = yield call(Api.fetchAutocomplete, action.text)\n  yield put({type: 'FETCHED_AUTOCOMPLETE_PROPOSALS', proposals: autocompleteProposals})\n}\n\nfunction* throttleAutocomplete() {\n  yield throttle(1000, 'FETCH_AUTOCOMPLETE', fetchAutocomplete)\n}\nNotesthrottle is a high-level API built using take, fork and actionChannel. Here is how the helper could be implemented using the low-level Effectsconst throttle = (ms, pattern, task, ...args) => fork(function*() {\n  const throttleChannel = yield actionChannel(pattern)\n\n  while (true) {\n    const action = yield take(throttleChannel)\n    yield fork(task, ...args, action)\n    yield call(delay, ms)\n  }\n})\n\nEffect creatorsNotes:Each function below returns a plain JavaScript object and does not perform any execution.\n\nThe execution is performed by the middleware during the Iteration process described above.\n\nThe middleware examines each Effect description and performs the appropriate action.\n\ntake(pattern)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for a specified action on the Store.\nThe Generator is suspended until an action that matches pattern is dispatched.pattern is interpreted using the following rules:If take is called with no arguments or '*' all dispatched actions are matched (e.g. take() will match all actions)\nIf it is a function, the action is matched if pattern(action) is true (e.g. take(action => action.entities) will match all actions having a (truthy) entitiesfield.)Note: if the pattern function has toString defined on it, action.type will be tested against pattern.toString() instead. This is useful if you're using an action creator library like redux-act or redux-actions.\nIf it is a String, the action is matched if action.type === pattern (e.g. take(INCREMENT_ASYNC)\nIf it is an array, each item in the array is matched with beforementioned rules, so the mixed array of strings and function predicates is supported. The most common use case is an array of strings though, so that action.type is matched against all items in the array (e.g. take([INCREMENT, DECREMENT]) and that would match either actions of type INCREMENT or DECREMENT).\nThe middleware provides a special action END. If you dispatch the END action, then all Sagas blocked on a take Effect will be terminated regardless of the specified pattern. If the terminated Saga has still some forked tasks which are still running, it will wait for all the child tasks to terminate before terminating the Task.take.maybe(pattern)Same as take(pattern) but does not automatically terminate the Saga on an END action. Instead all Sagas blocked on a take Effect will get the END object.Notestake.maybe got it name from the FP analogy - it's like instead of having a return type of ACTION (with automatic handling) we can have a type of Maybe(ACTION) so we can handle both cases:case when there is a Just(ACTION) (we have an action)\n\nthe case of NOTHING (channel was closed*). i.e. we need some way to map over END\ninternally all dispatched actions are going through the stdChannel which is geting closed when dispatch(END) happens\ntake(channel)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for a specified message from the provided Channel. If the channel is already closed, then the Generator will immediately terminate following the same process described above for take(pattern).take.maybe(channel)Same as take(channel) but does not automatically terminate the Saga on an END action. Instead all Sagas blocked on a take Effect will get the END object. See more hereput(action)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to dispatch an action to the Store.\nThis effect is non-blocking and any errors that are thrown downstream (e.g. in a reducer) will\nnot bubble back into the saga.action: Object - see Redux dispatch documentation for complete info\n\nput.resolve(action)Just like put but the effect is blocking (if promise is returned from dispatch it will wait for its resolution) and will bubble up errors from downstream.action: Object - see Redux dispatch documentation for complete info\n\nput(channel, action)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to put an action into the provided channel.channel: Channel - a Channel Object.\n\naction: Object - see Redux dispatch documentation for complete info\n\nThis effect is blocking if the put is not buffered but immediately consumed by takers. If an error\nis thrown in any of these takers it will bubble back into the saga.call(fn, ...args)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to call the function fn with args as arguments.fn: Function - A Generator function, or normal function which either returns a Promise as result, or any other value.\n\nargs: Array - An array of values to be passed as arguments to fn\n\nNotesfn can be either a normal or a Generator function.The middleware invokes the function and examines its result.If the result is an Iterator object, the middleware will run that Generator function, just like it did with the\nstartup Generators (passed to the middleware on startup). The parent Generator will be\nsuspended until the child Generator terminates normally, in which case the parent Generator\nis resumed with the value returned by the child Generator. Or until the child aborts with some\nerror, in which case an error will be thrown inside the parent Generator.If the result is a Promise, the middleware will suspend the Generator until the Promise is\nresolved, in which case the Generator is resumed with the resolved value. or until the Promise\nis rejected, in which case an error is thrown inside the Generator.If the result is not an Iterator object nor a Promise, the middleware will immediately return that value back to the saga,\nso that it can resume its execution synchronously.When an error is thrown inside the Generator. If it has a try/catch block surrounding the\ncurrent yield instruction, the control will be passed to the catch block. Otherwise,\nthe Generator aborts with the raised error, and if this Generator was called by another\nGenerator, the error will propagate to the calling Generator.call([context, fn], ...args)Same as call(fn, ...args) but supports passing a this context to fn. This is useful to\ninvoke object methods.call([context, fnName], ...args)Same as call([context, fn], ...args) but supports passing a fn as string. Useful for invoking object's methods, i.e. yield call([localStorage, 'getItem'], 'redux-saga')apply(context, fn, [args])Alias for call([context, fn], ...args).cps(fn, ...args)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to invoke fn as a Node style function.fn: Function - a Node style function. i.e. a function which accepts in addition to its arguments,\nan additional callback to be invoked by fn when it terminates. The callback accepts two parameters,\nwhere the first parameter is used to report errors while the second is used to report successful results\nargs: Array - an array to be passed as arguments for fn\nNotesThe middleware will perform a call fn(...arg, cb). The cb is a callback passed by the middleware to\nfn. If fn terminates normally, it must call cb(null, result) to notify the middleware\nof a successful result. If fn encounters some error, then it must call cb(error) in order to\nnotify the middleware that an error has occurred.The middleware remains suspended until fn terminates.cps([context, fn], ...args)Supports passing a this context to fn (object method invocation)fork(fn, ...args)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to perform a non-blocking call on fnArgumentsfn: Function - A Generator function, or normal function which returns a Promise as result\n\nargs: Array - An array of values to be passed as arguments to fn\n\nreturns a Task object.Notefork, like call, can be used to invoke both normal and Generator functions. But, the calls are\nnon-blocking, the middleware doesn't suspend the Generator while waiting for the result of fn.\nInstead as soon as fn is invoked, the Generator resumes immediately.fork, alongside race, is a central Effect for managing concurrency between Sagas.The result of yield fork(fn ...args) is a Task object.  An object with some useful\nmethods and properties.All forked tasks are attached to their parents. When the parent terminates the execution of its\nown body of instructions, it will wait for all forked tasks to terminate before returning.Errors from child tasks automatically bubble up to their parents. If any forked task raises an uncaught error, then\nthe parent task will abort with the child Error, and the whole Parent's execution tree (i.e. forked tasks + the\nmain task represented by the parent's body if it's still running) will be cancelled.Cancellation of a forked Task will automatically cancel all forked tasks that are still executing. It'll\nalso cancel the current Effect where the cancelled task was blocked (if any).If a forked task fails synchronously (ie: fails immediately after its execution before performing any\nasync operation), then no Task is returned, instead the parent will be aborted as soon as possible (since both\nparent and child executes in parallel, the parent will abort as soon as it takes notice of the child failure).To create detached forks, use spawn instead.fork([context, fn], ...args)Supports invoking forked functions with a this contextspawn(fn, ...args)Same as fork(fn, ...args) but creates a detached task. A detached task remains independent from its parent and acts like\na top-level task. The parent will not wait for detached tasks to terminate before returning and all events which may affect the\nparent or the detached task are completely independents (error, cancellation).spawn([context, fn], ...args)Supports spawning functions with a this contextjoin(task)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for the result\nof a previously forked task.task: Task - A Task object returned by a previous fork\n\nNotesjoin will resolve to the same outcome of the joined task (success or error). If the joined\ntask is cancelled, the cancellation will also propagate to the Saga executing the join\neffect. Similarly, any potential callers of those joiners will be cancelled as well.join(...tasks)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for the results of previously forked tasks.tasks: Array - A Task is the object returned by a previous fork\n\nNotesIt simply wraps the array of tasks in join effects, roughly becoming the equivalent of\nyield tasks.map(t => join(t)).cancel(task)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to cancel a previously forked task.task: Task - A Task object returned by a previous fork\n\nNotesTo cancel a running task, the middleware will invoke return on the underlying Generator\nobject. This will cancel the current Effect in the task and jump to the finally block (if defined).Inside the finally block, you can execute any cleanup logic or dispatch some action to keep the\nstore in a consistent state (e.g. reset the state of a spinner to false when an ajax request\nis cancelled). You can check inside the finally block if a Saga was cancelled by issuing\na yield cancelled().Cancellation propagates downward to child sagas. When cancelling a task, the middleware will also\ncancel the current Effect (where the task is currently blocked). If the current Effect\nis a call to another Saga, it will be also cancelled. When cancelling a Saga, all attached\nforks (sagas forked using yield fork()) will be cancelled. This means that cancellation\neffectively affects the whole execution tree that belongs to the cancelled task.cancel is a non-blocking Effect. i.e. the Saga executing it will resume immediately after\nperforming the cancellation.For functions which return Promise results, you can plug your own cancellation logic\nby attaching a [CANCEL] to the promise.The following example shows how to attach cancellation logic to a Promise result:import { CANCEL } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { fork, cancel } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction myApi() {\n  const promise = myXhr(...)\n\n  promise[CANCEL] = () => myXhr.abort()\n  return promise\n}\n\nfunction* mySaga() {\n\n  const task = yield fork(myApi)\n\n  // ... later\n  // will call promise[CANCEL] on the result of myApi\n  yield cancel(task)\n}\nredux-saga will automatically cancel jqXHR objects using their abort method.cancel(...tasks)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to cancel previously forked tasks.tasks: Array - A Task is the object returned by a previous fork\n\nNotesIt simply wraps the array of tasks in cancel effects, roughly becoming the equivalent of\nyield tasks.map(t => cancel(t)).cancel()Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to cancel a task in which it has been yielded (self cancellation).\nIt allows to reuse destructor-like logic inside a finally blocks for both outer (cancel(task)) and self (cancel()) cancellations.Examplefunction* deleteRecord({ payload }) {\n  try {\n    const { confirm, deny } = yield call(prompt);\n    if (confirm) {\n      yield put(actions.deleteRecord.confirmed())\n    }\n    if (deny) {\n      yield cancel()\n    }\n  } catch(e) {\n    // handle failure\n  } finally {\n    if (yield cancelled()) {\n      // shared cancellation logic\n      yield put(actions.deleteRecord.cancel(payload))\n    }\n  }\n}\nselect(selector, ...args)Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to invoke the provided selector on the\ncurrent Store's state (i.e. returns the result of selector(getState(), ...args)).selector: Function - a function (state, ...args) => args. It takes the\ncurrent state and optionally some arguments and returns a slice of the current Store's state\nargs: Array - optional arguments to be passed to the selector in addition of getState.\nIf select is called without argument (i.e. yield select()) then the effect is resolved\nwith the entire state (the same result of a getState() call).It's important to note that when an action is dispatched to the store, the middleware first\nforwards the action to the reducers and then notifies the Sagas. This means that when you query the\nStore's State, you get the State after the action has been applied.\nHowever, this behavior is only guaranteed if all subsequent middlewares call next(action) synchronously.  If any subsequent middleware calls next(action) asynchronously (which is unusual but possible), then the sagas will get the state from before the action is applied.  Therefore it is recommended to review the source of each subsequent middleware to ensure it calls next(action) synchronously, or else ensure that redux-saga is the last middleware in the call chain.NotesPreferably, a Saga should be autonomous and should not depend on the Store's state. This makes\nit easy to modify the state implementation without affecting the Saga code. A saga should preferably\ndepend only on its own internal control state when possible. But sometimes, one could\nfind it more convenient for a Saga to query the state instead of maintaining the needed data by itself\n(for example, when a Saga duplicates the logic of invoking some reducer to compute a state that was\nalready computed by the Store).For example, suppose we have this state shape in our application:state = {\n  cart: {...}\n}\nWe can create a selector, i.e. a function which knows how to extract the cart data from the State:./selectorsexport const getCart = state => state.cart\nThen we can use that selector from inside a Saga using the select Effect:./sagas.jsimport { take, fork, select } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport { getCart } from './selectors'\n\nfunction* checkout() {\n  // query the state using the exported selector\n  const cart = yield select(getCart)\n\n  // ... call some API endpoint then dispatch a success/error action\n}\n\nexport default function* rootSaga() {\n  while (true) {\n    yield take('CHECKOUT_REQUEST')\n    yield fork(checkout)\n  }\n}\ncheckout can get the needed information directly by using select(getCart). The Saga is coupled only with the getCart selector. If we have many Sagas (or React Components) that needs to access the cart slice, they will all be coupled to the same function getCart. And if we now change the state shape, we need only to update getCart.actionChannel(pattern, [buffer])Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to queue the actions matching pattern using an event channel. Optionally, you can provide a buffer to control buffering of the queued actions.pattern: - see API for take(pattern)\n\nbuffer: Buffer - a Buffer object\n\nExampleThe following code creates channel to buffer all USER_REQUEST actions. Note that even the Saga maybe blocked\non the call effect. All actions that come while it's blocked are automatically buffered. This causes the Saga\nto execute the API calls one at a timeimport { actionChannel, call } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport api from '...'\n\nfunction* takeOneAtMost() {\n  const chan = yield actionChannel('USER_REQUEST')\n  while (true) {\n    const {payload} = yield take(chan)\n    yield call(api.getUser, payload)\n  }\n}\nflush(channel)Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to flush all buffered items from the channel. Flushed items are returned back to the saga, so they can be utilized if needed.channel: Channel - a Channel Object.\n\nExample\nfunction* saga() {\n  const chan = yield actionChannel('ACTION')\n\n  try {\n    while (true) {\n      const action = yield take(chan)\n      // ...\n    }\n  } finally {\n    const actions = yield flush(chan)\n    // ...\n  }\n\n}\ncancelled()Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to return whether this generator has been cancelled. Typically\nyou use this Effect in a finally block to run Cancellation specific codeExample\nfunction* saga() {\n  try {\n    // ...\n  } finally {\n    if (yield cancelled()) {\n      // logic that should execute only on Cancellation\n    }\n    // logic that should execute in all situations (e.g. closing a channel)\n  }\n}\nsetContext(props)Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to update it's own context. This effect extends\nsaga's context instead of replacing it.getContext(prop)Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to return a specific property of saga's context.Effect combinatorsrace(effects)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to run a Race between\nmultiple Effects (this is similar to how Promise.race([...]) behaves).effects: Object - a dictionary Object of the form {label: effect, ...}ExampleThe following example runs a race between two effects:A call to a function fetchUsers which returns a Promise\n\nA CANCEL_FETCH action which may be eventually dispatched on the Store\n\nimport { take, call, race } from `redux-saga/effects`\nimport fetchUsers from './path/to/fetchUsers'\n\nfunction* fetchUsersSaga {\n  const { response, cancel } = yield race({\n    response: call(fetchUsers),\n    cancel: take(CANCEL_FETCH)\n  })\n}\nIf call(fetchUsers) resolves (or rejects) first, the result of race will be an object\nwith a single keyed object {response: result} where result is the resolved result of fetchUsers.If an action of type CANCEL_FETCH is dispatched on the Store before fetchUsers completes, the result\nwill be a single keyed object {cancel: action}, where action is the dispatched action.NotesWhen resolving a race, the middleware automatically cancels all the losing Effects.race([...effects]) (with Array)The same as race(effects) but let you to pass in an array of effects.ExampleThe following example runs a race between two effects:A call to a function fetchUsers which returns a Promise\n\nA CANCEL_FETCH action which may be eventually dispatched on the Store\n\nimport { take, call, race } from `redux-saga/effects`\nimport fetchUsers from './path/to/fetchUsers'\n\nfunction* fetchUsersSaga {\n  const [response, cancel] = yield race([\n    call(fetchUsers),\n    take(CANCEL_FETCH)\n  ])\n}\nIf call(fetchUsers) resolves (or rejects) first, response will be an result of fetchUsers and cancel will be undefined.If an action of type CANCEL_FETCH is dispatched on the Store before fetchUsers completes, response will be\nundefined and cancel will be the dispatched action.all([...effects]) - parallel effectsCreates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to run multiple Effects\nin parallel and wait for all of them to complete. It's quite the corresponding API to standard Promise#all.ExampleThe following example runs two blocking calls in parallel:import { fetchCustomers, fetchProducts } from './path/to/api'\nimport { all, call } from `redux-saga/effects`\n\nfunction* mySaga() {\n  const [customers, products] = yield all([\n    call(fetchCustomers),\n    call(fetchProducts)\n  ])\n}\nall(effects)The same as all([...effects]) but let's you to pass in a dictionary object of effects with labels, just like race(effects)effects: Object - a dictionary Object of the form {label: effect, ...}\n\nExampleThe following example runs two blocking calls in parallel:import { fetchCustomers, fetchProducts } from './path/to/api'\nimport { all, call } from `redux-saga/effects`\n\nfunction* mySaga() {\n  const { customers, products } = yield all({\n    customers: call(fetchCustomers),\n    products: call(fetchProducts)\n  })\n}\nNotesWhen running Effects in parallel, the middleware suspends the Generator until one of the following occurs:All the Effects completed with success: resumes the Generator with an array containing the results of all Effects.\nOne of the Effects was rejected before all the effects complete: throws the rejection error inside the Generator.\nInterfacesTaskThe Task interface specifies the result of running a Saga using fork, middleware.run or runSaga.\n  \n    method\n    return value\n  \n  \n    task.isRunning()\n    true if the task hasn't yet returned or thrown an error\n  \n  \n    task.isCancelled()\n    true if the task has been cancelled\n  \n  \n    task.result()\n    task return value. `undefined` if task is still running\n  \n  \n    task.error()\n    task thrown error. `undefined` if task is still running\n  \n  \n    task.done\n    \n      a Promise which is either:\n        \n          resolved with task's return value\n          rejected with task's thrown error\n        \n      \n  \n  \n    task.cancel()\n    Cancels the task (If it is still running)\n  \n\n\n\n\nChannelA channel is an object used to send and receive messages between tasks. Messages from senders are queued until an interested receiver request a message, and registered receiver is queued until a message is available.Every channel has an underlying buffer which defines the buffering strategy (fixed size, dropping, sliding)The Channel interface defines 3 methods: take, put and closeChannel.take(callback): used to register a taker. The take is resolved using the following rulesIf the channel has buffered messages, then callback will be invoked with the next message from the underlying buffer (using buffer.take())\n\nIf the channel is closed and there are no buffered messages, then callback is invoked with END\n\nOtherwisecallback will be queued until a message is put into the channel\n\nChannel.put(message): Used to put message on the buffer. The put will be handled using the following rulesIf the channel is closed, then the put will have no effect.\n\nIf there are pending takers, then invoke the oldest taker with the message.\n\nOtherwise put the message on the underlying buffer\n\nChannel.flush(callback): Used to extract all buffered messages from the channel. The flush is resolved using the following rulesIf the channel is closed and there are no buffered messages, then callback is invoked with END\n\nOtherwise callback is invoked with all buffered messages.\n\nChannel.close(): closes the channel which means no more puts will be allowed. All pending takers will be invoked with END.BufferUsed to implement the buffering strategy for a channel. The Buffer interface defines 3 methods: isEmpty, put and takeisEmpty(): returns true if there are no messages on the buffer. A channel calls this method whenever a new taker is registered\n\nput(message): used to put new message in the buffer. Note the Buffer can chose to not store the message\n(e.g. a dropping buffer can drop any new message exceeding a given limit)\n\ntake() used to retrieve any buffered message. Note the behavior of this method has to be consistent with isEmpty\n\nSagaMonitorUsed by the middleware to dispatch monitoring events. Actually the middleware dispatches 5 events:When an effect is triggered (via yield someEffect) the middleware invokes sagaMonitor.effectTriggered\nIf the effect is resolved with success the middleware invokes sagaMonitor.effectResolved\nIf the effect is rejected with an error the middleware invokes sagaMonitor.effectRejected\nIf the effect is cancelled the middleware invokes sagaMonitor.effectCancelled\nFinally, the middleware invokes sagaMonitor.actionDispatched when a Redux action is dispatched.\nBelow the signature for each methodeffectTriggered(options) : where options is an object with the following fieldseffectId : Number - Unique ID assigned to the yielded effect\nparentEffectId : Number - ID of the parent Effect. In the case of a race or parallel effect, all\neffects yielded inside will have the direct race/parallel effect as a parent. In case of a top-level effect, the\nparent will be the containing Saga\nlabel : String - In case of a race effect, all child effects will be assigned as label the corresponding\nkeys of the object passed to race\neffect : Object - the yielded effect itself\n\neffectResolved(effectId, result)effectId : Number - The ID of the yielded effect\nresult : any - The result of the successful resolution of the effect. In case of fork or spawn effects,\nthe result will be a Task object.\n\neffectRejected(effectId, error)effectId : Number - The ID of the yielded effect\nerror : any - Error raised with the rejection of the effect\n\neffectCancelled(effectId)effectId : Number - The ID of the yielded effect\n\n\nactionDispatched(action)action : Object - The dispatched Redux action. If the action was dispatched by a Saga\nthen the action will have a property SAGA_ACTION set to true (SAGA_ACTION can be imported from\nredux-saga/utils).\n\n\nExternal APIrunSaga(options, saga, ...args)Allows starting sagas outside the Redux middleware environment. Useful if you want to\nconnect a Saga to external input/output, other than store actions.runSaga returns a Task object. Just like the one returned from a fork effect.options: Object - currently supported options are:subscribe(callback): Function - A function which accepts a callback and returns an unsubscribe functioncallback(input): Function - callback(provided by runSaga) used to subscribe to input events. subscribe must support registering multiple subscriptions.\ninput: any - argument passed by subscribe to callback (see Notes below)\n\n\n\n\ndispatch(output): Function - used to fulfill put effects.output: any -  argument provided by the Saga to the put Effect (see Notes below).\n\n\ngetState(): Function - used to fulfill select and getState effects\nsagaMonitor : SagaMonitor - see docs for createSagaMiddleware(options)\nlogger: Function - see docs for createSagaMiddleware(options)\nonError: Function - see docs for createSagaMiddleware(options)\nsaga: Function - a Generator function\nargs: Array - arguments to be provided to saga\nNotesThe {subscribe, dispatch} is used to fulfill take and put Effects. This defines the Input/Output\ninterface of the Saga.subscribe is used to fulfill take(PATTERN) effects. It must call callback every time it\nhas an input to dispatch (e.g. on every mouse click if the Saga is connected to DOM click events).\nEach time subscribe emits an input to its callbacks, if the Saga is blocked on a take effect, and\nif the take pattern matches the currently incoming input, the Saga is resumed with that input.dispatch is used to fulfill put effects. Each time the Saga emits a yield put(output), dispatch\nis invoked with output.Utilschannel([buffer])A factory method that can be used to create Channels. You can optionally pass it a buffer\nto control how the channel buffers the messages.By default, if no buffer is provided, the channel will queue incoming messages up to 10 until interested takers are registered. The default buffering will deliver message using a FIFO strategy: a new taker will be delivered the oldest message in the buffer.eventChannel(subscribe, [buffer], [matcher])Creates channel that will subscribe to an event source using the subscribe method. Incoming events from the event source will be queued in the channel until interested takers are registered.subscribe: Function used to subscribe to the underlying event source. The function must return an unsubscribe function to terminate the subscription.\nbuffer: Buffer optional Buffer object to buffer messages on this channel. If not provided messages will not buffered\non this channel.\nmatcher: Function optional predicate function (any => Boolean) to filter incoming messages. Only messages accepted by\nthe matcher will be put on the channel.\nTo notify the channel that the event source has terminated, you can notify the provided subscriber with an ENDExampleIn the following example we create an event channel that will subscribe to a setIntervalconst countdown = (secs) => {\n  return eventChannel(emitter => {\n      const iv = setInterval(() => {\n        console.log('countdown', secs)\n        secs -= 1\n        if (secs > 0) {\n          emitter(secs)\n        } else {\n          emitter(END)\n          clearInterval(iv)\n          console.log('countdown terminated')\n        }\n      }, 1000);\n      return () => {\n        clearInterval(iv)\n        console.log('countdown cancelled')\n      }\n    }\n  )\n}\nbuffersProvides some common buffersbuffers.none(): no buffering, new messages will be lost if there are no pending takers\nbuffers.fixed(limit): new messages will be buffered up to limit. Overflow will raises an Error. Omitting a limit value will result in a limit of 10.\nbuffers.expanding(initialSize): like fixed but Overflow will cause the buffer to expand dynamically.\nbuffers.dropping(limit): same as fixed but Overflow will silently drop the messages.\nbuffers.sliding(limit): same as fixed but Overflow will insert the new message at the end and drop the oldest message in the buffer.\ndelay(ms, [val])Returns a Promise that will resolve after ms milliseconds with val.cloneableGenerator(generatorFunc)Takes a generator function (function*) and returns a generator function.\nAll generators instanciated from this function will be cloneable.\nFor testing purpose only.ExampleThis is useful when you want to test different branch of a saga without having to replay the actions that lead to it.\nfunction* oddOrEven() {\n  // some stuff are done here\n  yield 1;\n  yield 2;\n  yield 3;\n\n  const userInput = yield 'enter a number';\n  if (userInput % 2 === 0) {\n    yield 'even';\n  } else {\n    yield 'odd'\n  }\n}\n\ntest('my oddOrEven saga', assert => {\n  const data = {};\n  data.gen = cloneableGenerator(oddOrEven)();\n\n  assert.equal(\n    data.gen.next().value,\n    1,\n    'it should yield 1'\n  );\n\n  assert.equal(\n    data.gen.next().value,\n    2,\n    'it should yield 2'\n  );\n\n  assert.equal(\n    data.gen.next().value,\n    3,\n    'it should yield 3'\n  );\n\n  assert.equal(\n    data.gen.next().value,\n    'enter a number',\n    'it should ask for a number'\n  );\n\n  assert.test('even number is given', a => {\n    // we make a clone of the generator before giving the number;\n    data.clone = data.gen.clone();\n\n    a.equal(\n      data.gen.next(2).value,\n      'even',\n      'it should yield \"event\"'\n    );\n\n    a.equal(\n      data.gen.next().done,\n      true,\n      'it should be done'\n    );\n\n    a.end();\n  });\n\n  assert.test('odd number is given', a => {\n\n    a.equal(\n      data.clone.next(1).value,\n      'odd',\n      'it should yield \"odd\"'\n    );\n\n    a.equal(\n      data.clone.next().done,\n      true,\n      'it should be done'\n    );\n\n    a.end();\n  });\n\n  assert.end();\n});\n\ncreateMockTask()Returns an object that mocks a task.\nFor testing purposes only.\nSee Task Cancellation docs for more information.\n)CheatsheetsBlocking / Non-blocking\n\nName\nBlocking\n\ntakeEvery\nNo\ntakeLatest\nNo\nthrottle\nNo\ntake\nYes\ntake(channel)\nSometimes (see API reference)\ntake.maybe\nYes\nput\nNo\nput.resolve\nYes\nput(channel, action)\nNo\ncall\nYes\napply\nYes\ncps\nYes\nfork\nNo\nspawn\nNo\njoin\nYes\ncancel\nNo\nselect\nNo\nactionChannel\nNo\nflush\nYes\ncancelled\nYes\nrace\nYes\nall\nBlocks if there is a blocking effect in the array or object\n\n\n"}}}
